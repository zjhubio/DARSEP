# DARSEP
Here we propose DARSEP, a reinforcement learning-based self-game sequence optimization and RetNet learning network-based SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence modelling approach that can predict evolutionary sequences and explore antigenic evolution.
## Components
- `data` : Required data
- `src` : Python code of DARSEP-SPRLM and DARSEP-PMLM
- `results` : Directory for the results
- `analysis` : Jupyter notebooks for all the analysis and plots
## Requirements
